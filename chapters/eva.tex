\chapter{Extraction and VAlidation Framework (EVA)}
 
 \section{Motivation}
The goal of the EVA framework is to produce a self-validating means of extracting the parameters of TMD models from experimental data.  Synthetic data sets can be generated by choosing a model and a set of test parameters.  These events are passed off to experimental analysts, who treat them as MC and perform full analysis measurements of SIDIS observables on them, before returning the results back to the EVA framework.  The frameworks mechanism for extracting/fitting parameters of the same model is then applied to this data set, and the results are validated with the known inputs.
