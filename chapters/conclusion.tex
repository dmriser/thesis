\chapter{Conclusion}

Two novel measurements have been presented.  First, reports of the non-zero BSA for positively charged k-mesons was reported in chapter 7.  These results represent a significant effort and certainly add to the currently sparse data regarding kaon structure functions in SIDIS.  Additionally, this measurement serves as another verification that at JLab 6 GeV kinematics twist-three terms in the TMD framework seem to have important contributions.  Finally, the application of fitting techniques from other analysis disciplines to this work has hopefully encouraged other analysts to explore more powerful approaches to extracting important physics parameters from messy data.  

Second, the unpolarized SIDIS cross section for $\pi^{\pm}$ presented here represents the first measurement of its type, providing the magnitude of the unpolarized structure functions over a wide kinematic range.  We anticipate that these results will serve as useful inputs for extraction of the unpolarized and Boer-Mulders TMD functions.
