% 1. The Hof 
%Prior to 1955 scientists thought that the proton was a point-like particle (having mass, but no spatial extent).  This became a testable hypothesis in 1952 with the ability to accelerate electrons up to 1 GeV using the Stanford "Mark III".  Theoretical tools of the day were sufficiently advanced to predict what the electron-proton scattering cross section should be, assuming that they interact electromagnetically as point particles \cite{history-rosenbluth:1950}.  That year Hofstadter and McAllister setup an experiment to collide electrons between 100-200MeV into stationary protons in their laboratory in Stanford, California and their findings would create the field of nucleon structure research, a field that remains very active today \cite{history-hofstadter:1955, history-hofstadter:1956, history-chambers:1956}.  Hoftstader observed a significant deviation of the cross section from that predicted Rosenbluth cross section.  We now know that Hofstadter was observing the scattering of electrons from the charged quarks which compose it, and discovering that the proton is not a point-like fundamental particle.

Research into the internal structure of protons and neutrons began in 1955 with the pioneering work of Hofstadter and McAllister.  Working together at Standford, the pair measured the electron-proton scattering cross section with 188 MeV electrons that were incident on a hydrogen target. Their analysis demonstrated that at large angles the measured cross section was inconsistent with the cross section predicted for a point-like proton.  Simultaneously, the Brookhaven Cosmotron produced an overwhelming number of new particles, creating what was dubbed a "particle zoo".  Theoretical efforts by Gell-Mann and Zwieg produced a system of categorizing the particles by their charge and strangeness, and eventually the basis for constructing these in terms of a new type of fractionally charged particle that Gell-Mann coined the quark.

%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eqn:rosenbluth}
%	\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4 E_{1}^{2} sin^4(\theta/2)} \frac{E_3}{E_1} \left( \frac{G_{E}^2 + \tau G_{M}^2}{1 + \tau} cos^2(\theta/2) + 2 \tau G_{M}^2sin^2(\theta/2) \right)
%\end{equation}
%
%Where $\tau = \frac{Q^2}{4m_{p}^2}$.

%The Hofstadter results left physicists with a clear conclusion, the proton isn't point-like. To develop a hypothesis that explained what type of particle or particles protons and neutrons are made of would take ten years of further experimentation.  During that time particle accelerators increased in energy, until collisions became so energetic that new particles were produced.  At first, physicists interpreted this "particle zoo" as all new fundamental particles.  In 1966 Murray Gell-Mann and Somebody Somewhere explained this proliferation of particles as combinations of three more fundamental particles.  The idea that a complicated set of observed particles could be reduced to a simpler basis set of fundamental particles introduced a welcome simplification, but also introduced fractionally charged particles. Despite the large volume of scattering experiments taking place, fractionally charged particles had never been detected, and still haven't today.  The conclusion was that these new "quarks" are never found alone, but always in pairs or groups.

% 3. DIS and SFs
\section{Deeply Inelastic Scattering and Structure Functions}
%	Experiments in which an electron collides with a stationary proton at very high energies (much more than the mass of the proton) called deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments began at the Stanford Linear Accelerator in 1966 shortly after the machine was commissioned.  The cross section from deeply inelastic electron-proton scattering can be parametrized in terms of two structure functions ($F_1(x, Q^2)$ $F2(x,Q^2)$).  By comparing the parton model cross section to this parametrization, the structure functions can be related to the PDFs.  Interestingly, the parton model implies that both $F_1$ and $F_2$ should be independent of $Q^2$.  This prediction came to be known as Bjorken scaling, and when it was observed in the early 1970s at SLAC confidence in the parton model picture swelled.

In contrast to elastic scattering, when kinetic energy of the scattered electron is not conserved the reaction is called inelastic scattering.  As the incident energy of electrons in scattering experiments grows larger than the proton mass, the inelastic scattering cross section begins to become dominant.  In a deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) event, an electron collides with the target particle and transfer sufficient energy to interrogate it on a distance scale much smaller than its radius, and is then detected.  The DIS cross section can be decomposed in terms of two structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$.  

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:sfs}
	\frac{d^2\sigma}{dx dQ^2} = \frac{4 \pi \alpha^2}{Q^4} \left\lbrace \left( 1 - y - \frac{m_p^2 y^2}{Q^2} \right) \frac{F_2(x,Q^2)}{x} + y^2 F_1 (x,Q^2) \right\rbrace
\end{equation}

The electron kinematics are described by the four momentum transfer $q^{\mu} = k^{\mu} - k'^{\mu}$, the negative momentum transfer $Q^2 = - q^{\mu} q_{\mu}$ and,
\begin{align}  
  x = \frac{Q^{2}}{2P \cdot q} && y = \frac{P \cdot q}{P \cdot l} 
\end{align}

where $x$ is called the momentum fraction and $y$ is the inelasticity.  The variable $x$ (which will appear throughout this thesis) is bounded between zero and one and describes the fraction of the total proton momentum carried by the quark struck in the scattering.  For the case that $Q^2 \gg m_p^2 y^2$ the cross section reduces further.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:sfs2}
	\frac{d^2\sigma}{dx dQ^2} \approx \frac{4 \pi \alpha^2}{Q^4} \left\lbrace \left( 1 - y \right) \frac{F_2(x,Q^2)}{x} + y^2 F_1 (x,Q^2) \right\rbrace
\end{equation}

\section{The Parton Model and Parton Distribution Functions}
Feynman's "parton model" (1969) stated that during high energy electron-proton collisions the electron enters with so much energy that the quarks which compose the proton are essentially stationary, and the electron simply scatters off of one part (quark or gluon) of the nucleus.  This "parton" model assumed that the cross section for electron-proton scattering was the product of an elastic scattering between a charged electron and quark (calculable using techniques from quantum electrodynamics), and a function that describes the momentum of the quark in the proton prior to the collision, called the parton distribution function (PDF).  Parton distribution functions are indexed with the variable $x$ that represents the fractional proton momentum carried by the struck quark.

	\caption[A diagrammatic representation of deeply inelastic scattering.]{Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) between a lepton and a hadron, in this thesis an electron and a proton.}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:sfs-pdf}
	\frac{d^2\sigma}{dx dQ^2} = \frac{4 \pi \alpha^2}{Q^4} \left\lbrace 1 - y + \frac{y^2}{2} \right\rbrace \sum_{i} Q_i^2 q_i^p (x)
\end{equation}

In the equation above $q_i^p (x)$ is the proton PDF for quark flavor $i$.  When equating \ref{eqn:sfs2} with \ref{eqn:sfs-pdf} Bjorken scaling for $ep$ DIS falls out.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:bjorken-scaling}
	F_{2} (x, Q^2) = 2xF_1 (x, Q^2) = x \sum_{i} Q_i^2 q_i^p(x)
\end{equation}

\section{HERA}
The HERA electron-proton collider, which operated from 1991-2007 at DESY studied DIS extensively at large $Q^2 > 200 \; GeV^2$ and small $x < 0.0001$ by colliding 27.5 GeV electrons and 820/920 GeV protons.  The H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA mapped out the proton structure functions in great detail.  The results (shown in figure) display a weak dependence on $Q^2$; a feature which can be calculated using the DGLAP evolution equations, providing more support for the simple partonic picture.  The PDFs extracted from these structure functions show that almost half of the proton momentum is carried by gluons (and quark/anti-quark pairs created by their splitting).   

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{image/plots/introduction/f2.jpg}	
	\caption[$F_{2} (Q^2)$ results from HERA]{HERA experiments ZEUS and H1 mapped out the structure function $F_2$, which displayed the predicted Bjorken scaling for most values of $x$.   The mild $Q^2$ dependence of the PDFs can be calculated using the DGLAP evolution equations for the PDFs, providing an understanding for the observed dependence.}
\end{figure}

\section{Semi-Inclusive Deeply Inelastic Scattering}
In 1996 it was realized by Mulders that by detecting a hadron in the final state of an electron-proton deeply inelastic scattering event (a reaction known as semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering), one could learn about the quark momentum in the plane transverse to the hard scattering direction along which the momentum fraction $x$ is defined.  In an analogous manner to the DIS electron-proton cross section, the cross section for SIDIS can be decomposed into a set of 18 structure functions (depending on the polarization direction of the electron and proton). 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\label{fig:tmd-table}
	\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{image/diagrams/tmd-table.jpg}	
	\caption[Leading order TMD table.]{The twist two TMDs are tabulated in terms of their spin decomposition.}
\end{figure}

\section{Transverse Momentum Dependent Functions}
In analogue with the simple co-linear case, parton model-like assumptions are made about the nature of the scattering and all 18 of these structure functions can be calculated in terms of TMD PDFs and TMD Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs).  The new assumption, known as factorization, is at the core of the applicability of the TMD interpretation to results of SIDIS (and other types such as Drell-Yan scattering) experiments.  The hadronic matrix element that describes the transition from proton to all possible final states is decomposed using the operator product expansion (OPE) and factorization has been proven for the SIDIS process at leading order in the expansion (twist two) [reference here].

\begin{figure}

	\caption[Diagrammatic representation of SIDIS with hadronic $\phi_h$ angle.]{In a SIDIS event the scattered electron is detected as well as one final state hadron, allowing for the calculation of the angle $\phi_h$ which appears frequently in the SIDIS cross section.}
\end{figure}

What results from this expansion is the set of non-perturbative TMD PDF and TMD FF functions, at twist two in the expansion there are 9 such functions, at twist three there are 16.  By comparing kinematic dependence, these functions can be associated with structure functions in the cross section decomposition.

% Not part of MVP 
%Starting in the early 2000s, collaborations  (HERA, HERMES, references) began measuring these structure functions and one pronounced effect came to be known as the Sivers effect, which is associated with the Sivers function, a twist two TMD.  After observing the sizable Sivers asymmetry, it was clear that the TMD framework has explanatory power and validity.  Up to the present time, measurements of TMD PDFs and TMD FFs have endured as pilot experiments (a full review of the current situation was given in [reference to TMD review from experiment]).

% 8. This Thesis and 9a. Unpolarized 
In this thesis I present two distinct measurements of SIDIS structure functions and their combinations.  The first observable measured is the unpolarized cross section, which is presented as an extension of the analysis of Nathan Harrison who measured the unnormalized cross sections for charged pions in CLAS [reference to Nate].  Three structure functions appear in this cross section expansion, those which have the unpolarized beam and target subscripts "UU" in the cross section equation.  The leading structure function is not modulated by the phi dependent angle of the outgoing hadron, and is expected to be dominant in size when compared with the two co-sinusoidal structure functions that remain.  This novel measurement compliments the unnormalized work of Nathan Harrison as well as the measurements of multiplicities performed by the HERMES and COMPASS collaborations [reference both of those].  Without applying the TMD framework, this measurement still has value in that it provides the scale of the structure functions for the first time and can be used to predict SIDIS yields for future studies.  Within the TMD framework, the leading order unpolarized structure function is composed of the unpolarized PDF and the unpolarized fragmentation function, both fairly well known from previous experiments.  The phi modulated structure functions contain a TMD PDF known as the Boer-Mulders function, pursued for its possible connection to quark orbital angular momentum.  I expect that the results of this measurement can be used as input, with results from other experiments, to extract the Boer-Mulders TMD using a phenomenological model.

% 9b. BSA 
I also present measurements of positively charged kaon beam spin asymmetries, which addresses several interesting areas of TMD physics.  The beam spin asymmetry, defined as the difference in events observed for different electron helicity states (normalized by the total number of electrons), depends on the observable structure function (F LU SIN PHI).  Interestingly, if one assumes that twist three PDFs and FFs are zero, the beam spin asymmetry term vanishes because the structure function in question is composed of pure twist three products of PDFs and FFs.

% 10. Wes Gohn 
Recently CLAS reported the non-zero BSA measurement of charged and neutral pion beam spin asymmetries, which implies that in the kinematics measured by CLAS, the twist three TMD terms cannot be neglected [reference to Wes Gohn thesis].  As a natural extension of this knowledge, I analyze the same observable for the heavier kaon channel to see if the same conclusion is realized.

% Structural overview of thesis 
I have reviewed the experimental hardware that enables this thesis work in chapter 2 and summarized analytical techniques used during chapter 3.  I describe basic analysis procedures that are common to both measurements in chapter 4 before discussing particle identification in chapter 5.  I present results for the inclusive scattering cross section in chapter 6, followed by the SIDIS cross section in chapter 7.  I then present my findings for the positively charged kaon BSA measurement in chapter 8 before offering a brief summary and outlook in chapter 9.

\begin{equation}
  e(l) + h(P) \rightarrow e'(l') + h(P_{h}) + X 
\end{equation}

In SIDIS it is customary to define the following kinematic variables (where $q = l - l'$ and $Q^{2} = -q^{2}$). 

\begin{align}
  x = \frac{Q^{2}}{2P \cdot q} && y = \frac{P \cdot q}{P \cdot l} && z = \frac{P \cdot P_{h}}{P \cdot q} && \gamma = \frac{2Mx}{Q}
\end{align}

Additionally, the ratio $\varepsilon$ of the longitudinal and transverse photon flux is shown below.

Here $\lambda_e$ refers to the helicity of the incoming lepton (beam electron in our case).  If one decomposes the hadronic matrix element which is present in the hadronic tensor into different possible Dirac structures, a set of functions known as transverse momentum dependent parton distributions functions (TMD PDFs) and transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions (TMD FFs) can be defined.  The structure functions from above can then be calculated as a convolution of these more basic non-perturbative functions.  The notation $\mathcal{C}$ is shorhtand  presented in \cite{tmds-bacchetta:2006} as a way to write structure functions in terms of the convolutions of PDF and FF objects.

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{C}[\omega f D] = x \sum_{a} e^{2}_{a} \int d^{2}\pt d^{2}\kt \delta^{(2)} \left( z\kt + \pt - \vect{P}_{h\perp} \right) \omega (\kt, \pt) f^{a}(x, k_{T}^{2}) D^{a}(z, p_{T}^{2}) 
\end{equation}

where a is summed over quarks and anti-quarks.  The five structure functions appearing in the cross section are, 

\begin{equation}
F_{UU,T} = \mathcal{C}[f_1 D_1] = x \sum_{a} e^{2}_{a} \int d^{2} \pt d^{2} \kt \delta^{(2)} \left( z\kt + \pt - \vect{P}_{h\perp} \right) f_{1}^{a}(x, k_{T}^{2}) D_{1}^{a}(z, p_{T}^{2})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F_{UU,L} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F_{UU}^{\cos \phi_h} = \frac{2M}{Q} \mathcal{C}[ - \frac{\hhat \cdot \kt}{M_h} \Bigl( x h H_{1}^{\perp} + \frac{M_h}{M} f_1 \frac{\tilde{D}^{\perp}}{z} \Bigr) - \frac{\hhat \cdot \pt}{M} \Bigl( x f^{\perp} D_1 + \frac{M_h}{M} h_1^{\perp} \frac{\tilde{H}}{z} \Bigr)]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F_{UU}^{\cos 2\phi_h} = \mathcal{C}[- \frac{2 (\vect{\hat{h}} \cdot \kt) (\vect{\hat{h}} \cdot \pt) - \kt \cdot \pt}{M M_h} h_{1}^{\perp} H_{1}^{\perp} ]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  F_{LU}^{\sin\phi} = \frac{2M}{Q} \mathcal{C} \Bigl[ -\frac{\hhat \cdot \kt}{M_h} \Bigl( xeH_1^\perp + \frac{M_h}{M} f_1 \frac{\tilde{G}^\perp}{z} \Bigr) + \frac{\hhat \cdot \pt}{M} \Bigl( xg^\perp D_1 + \frac{M_h}{M} h_{1}^{\perp} \frac{\tilde{E}}{z} \Bigr) \Bigr]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  BSA = \frac{d\sigma^+ - d\sigma^-}{d\sigma^+ + d\sigma^-} = \frac{\phimod{LU}{\sin\phi}}{1 + \phimod{UU}{\cos\phi} + \phimod{UU}{\cos(2\phi)}}
\end{equation}

Where the coefficient $A_{LU}^{\sin\phi}$ is defined as, 

\begin{equation}
  A_{LU}^{\sin\phi} = \sqrt{2\,\varepsilon (1-\varepsilon)} \frac{F_{LU}^{\sin\phi}}{F_{UU,T} + \varepsilon F_{UU,L}}
\end{equation}
