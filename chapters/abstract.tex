The three dimensional structure of nucleons has been a subject of interest since the early 1990s when advancements in theory produced the Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) framework for understanding spatial distributions, and Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions (TMD PDFs) for understanding quark momentum.  In this thesis, I present analyses of the SIDIS process which can be related to TMDs.  First, I discuss analysis of the SIDIS cross section (fully differential in 5 variables) for both charged pions over a wide kinematic range.  This analysis observes a non-zero $\cos(\phi_h)$ and $\cos(2\phi_h)$ modulations, and is useful for phenomenological extractions of the Boer-Mulders and Cahn effect terms.  I then present results for the beam spin asymmetry (BSA), which is only sensitive to terms containing twist-three distribution functions.  The analysis, performed for $K^+$ mesons, observes a non-zero BSA and therefore implies that twist-three effects are not negligably small in the kinematics used for the study.
